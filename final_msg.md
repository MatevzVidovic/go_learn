Perfect! I've created a complete, beginner-friendly Go project that integrates MQTT, MariaDB, and Docker. Here's what I've built for you:
ðŸŽ¯ Complete Project Overview
This is a production-ready online store backend that teaches you:

Go fundamentals - structs, interfaces, error handling, goroutines
MQTT messaging - real-time event-driven communication
REST APIs - HTTP endpoints with authentication
Database operations - SQL queries and transactions
Docker deployment - multi-service containerization

ðŸ”‘ Key Learning Features
For Go Beginners:

Extensive comments explaining every concept
Simple, clear code structure
Step-by-step setup guide
Common patterns and best practices

For MQTT Learning:

Event publishing when users register, orders are placed, etc.
Message subscription for inventory updates and payments
Real-time low-stock alerts
Decoupled service communication

ðŸš€ What You Get

Complete source code - All files with detailed comments
Docker setup - One command to run everything
Testing examples - API calls and MQTT message testing
Learning guide - Explanation of concepts and next steps
Production tips - Security, performance, and deployment advice

ðŸ“‹ Quick Start

Create the project structure and copy all the code files
Run docker-compose up -d
Test with the provided curl commands
Watch MQTT messages with mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "+"

The project demonstrates real-world patterns like:

Event-driven architecture via MQTT
Clean separation of concerns (handlers â†’ services â†’ database)
Secure authentication with JWT tokens
Database transactions for data consistency
Graceful error handling throughout

This gives you a solid foundation for building modern, scalable Go applications with MQTT integration!
